📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
🚀 Overview
This project is a complete pipeline for detecting fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). Built in Python, it leverages scikit-learn, NLTK, and visualization libraries to process news data and classify it as real or fake with high accuracy.

The goal of this project is to build a reliable text-based classifier that can distinguish fake news using:

🧹 Text preprocessing (Cleaning, Tokenization, Stopwords Removal, Stemming)

✨ TF-IDF Vectorization for converting text to numerical features

🧠 Logistic Regression Model for classification

📊 Visual Explorations (Word Clouds, Count Plots)

📈 Performance Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Classification Report)

🔁 Cross-validation to test model robustness

📚 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Data Handling: pandas, numpy

NLP: nltk, wordcloud

Machine Learning: scikit-learn

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

This project provides an end-to-end solution for fake news detection and serves as a solid base for text classification problems in real-world scenarios.

📁 Dataset
Dataset is from Kaggle Fake News Dataset and includes:

📝 title — News headline

👤 author — Article author

🏷️ label — 1 = Fake, 0 = Real

ℹ️ The text column is present but not used in this version.

📊 Features & Visualizations
🔢 Label Distribution Plot

☁️ Word Cloud of most frequent words (after stemming & stopword removal)

🧠 Model Evaluation

Metric	Score

⚙️ Installation
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure to download NLTK stopwords if running for the first time:

python
Copy
Edit
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
🚀 Run the Project
Clone the repo and execute the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detector.git
cd fake-news-detector
python main.py
✅ Sample Prediction
At the end of the script, a random article from the test set is selected to demonstrate prediction:

🔮 Predicted Label — Fake or Real

🎯 Actual Label — Fake or Real

📌 Future Enhancements
Use the full article text for better classification

Implement advanced models like Random Forest, SVM, or BERT

Build a real-time Flask or Streamlit web interface
